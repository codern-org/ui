# Web Frontend

A graphical user interface on the website of Codern. This repository distributes static files for serving with HTTP/HTTPS server.

We've opted for [React](https://react.dev/) to create this web application because of its robust community support. This support facilitates both our developers and open-source contributors in making improvements to the project seamlessly.

ðŸ’– A special thanks goes to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for their beautifully designed components. These components have been instrumental in crafting our web application, serving as a significant part of our design framework.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository contains the Web Frontend of Codern only. If you are interested in exploring how the Codern backend was created, please visit the link [here](https://github.com/codern-org/codern).

> This project also serves as an experimental playground for the founders of Codern, allowing them to learn and develop a robust system as part of their Computer Engineering senior project.

## Contribution

We highly recommended [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.
